# Thesis-Template
This template is intended as a primarily technical jump-start for writing a PhD thesis
using LaTeX. The template is originally based on a well-crafted design by Prof. Wilhelm
Burger and has been updated by Prof. Michael Haller for the Free University of
Bozen-Bolzano. The template works for  Master/Bachelor/PhD theses.
